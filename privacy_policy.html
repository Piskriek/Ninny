    <h1>🌸 Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>App Name:</strong> Little Bloom Academy<br>
        <strong>Last Updated:</strong> 27 February 2026
    </p>

    <p>Little Bloom Academy ("the App") is a Grade R educational learning programme designed for young children (ages
        4–6) to use together with their parent or guardian. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what
        information we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Little Bloom Academy <strong>does not collect, transmit, or share any personal information</strong>. All data
        created while using the App (progress records, star counts, guardian notes, and activity logs) is stored
        <strong>exclusively on your device</strong> using your browser's <code>localStorage</code>. This data never
        leaves your device and is never sent to any external server.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>We take children's privacy extremely seriously. The App is designed for use by young children alongside a parent
        or guardian. We do <strong>not</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Collect names, photos, or any personally identifiable information from children</li>
        <li>Display third-party advertising</li>
        <li>Track usage analytics or behaviour</li>
        <li>Require an account, login, or registration</li>
        <li>Connect to the internet during normal gameplay (the App works offline)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Progress data (stars earned, activities completed, and caretaker notes) is saved locally on your device using the
        browser's built-in <code>localStorage</code>. This data can be deleted at any time by clearing your browser/app
        cache, or by using the built-in "Reset Progress" button in the Guardian Progress dashboard.</p>

    <h2>4. Premium Features</h2>
    <p>The App offers optional premium content ("Extended Play"). The unlocked premium status is stored locally on your
        device. No financial transaction data is processed by the App itself. Any purchases are handled securely through
        the Google Play Store billing system.</p>

    <h2>5. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App requests no special device permissions (no camera, microphone, location, or contacts access is required
        or requested).</p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last Updated" date above. We encourage you to
        review this page periodically.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact us at:<br>
